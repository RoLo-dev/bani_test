        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <h3>Our Guarantee</h3>
        <p>Bani Bakery will provide a professionally decorated dessert in a timely manner as specified in the invoice or contract. We appreciate your business and we're honored that you have chosen us for your special celebration. We guarantee that the flavors, size, and general design elements will be met as outlined. If you are not satisfied with our product(s) please let us know at the time you receive your order. Once your order is accepted, refunds will not be considered.</p>

        <h3>Allergy Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>Please be aware that although we have strict processes in place to prevent cross-contact there is still a slight risk of the presence of any allergen.</p>

        <h3>Deposits, Payments, Cancellations</h3>
        <p>A deposit of 50% is required to be considered an order. The remaining balance will be paid on the day of pick up or delivery. Any changes to this order must be made no later than ten (10) business days prior to delivery. Any changes requested after the signing of this contract cannot be guaranteed and may be subject to additional charges. Deposits are non-refundable when 4 days prior to due date. Cancellation with more than 4 days notice, credit may be given for a future order.</p>

        <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>We don't offer refunds or exchanges for custom products that meet our quality standards once a cake has been picked up/delivered and “Accepted” by you or another designated party. Additionally, under no circumstances will Bani bakery provide a refund in excess of the cost of the order. All products are the responsibility of the customer once it leaves our possession. Refund requests due to decorating style, color shade or general decoration design will not be honored or considered. We only give refunds if the product does not meet the flavor, size, and general description detailed above.</p>
        <p>Cake flavor and texture is subjective. Refunds requested due to flavor or texture after cake has been accepted and picked up will be at the sole discretion of Bani Bakery. We may consider a store credit if the product is brought back to us and the quality of the cake flavor or texture is determined not to meet our standards within 24 hours of your event. Please note, we do taste our cakes daily to insure the highest quality. Quality determination is solely at the discretion of Bani Bakery. Our cakes are baked from scratch with all natural ingredients, and need to be kept out at room temperature for at least an hour prior to serving. Keep in mind, variety in temperature and humidity may impact the flavor, overall design, or texture of the cake to some degree. Please understand we cannot control changes in texture or changes in color or shape due to weather conditions.</p>

        <h3>Cake and Handling</h3>
        <p>We are not responsible for any damage to the cake after pick-up or after setup is complete. The client is responsible for providing an appropriate and secure table and environment for the cake(s). Cakes are heavy and require a sturdy table, and optimal room temperature of 70 degrees or below. If you or your representative elects to pick up and set up the cake, you assume all liability and responsibility for the condition of the cake once it leaves the possession of Bani Bakery.</p>
        <p> In the case of fresh flower usage on the cake, the responsibility of the flower safety and safe food practices will rest with the florist and not with Bani Bakery. The person placing this order should obtain a notice of plant safety, in question, from the florist. Bani bakery is not responsible for any damage to the cake caused by the placement of flowers by another party or other items on the cake.</p>
